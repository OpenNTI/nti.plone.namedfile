plone.namedfile Installation
----------------------------

To install nti.plone.namedfile into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run
  ``easy_install nti.plone.namedfile``.

* Create a file called ``configure.zcml`` in your project the directory.  
  The file should only contain this::

    <include package="plone.namedfile" />
